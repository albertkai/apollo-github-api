## Simple app to test Apollo with Github GraphQL API.

Before running the app, replace the `REACT_APP_GITHUB_SECRET` variable value in the `.env` file with your github secret

### Then do:
```
yarn install && yarn start
```

All the business logic, including Redux and Apollo is in `scr/api`, all the components - in `src/ui`.
Styling solution - `styled-components`
